# This is an example config file for a wireguard network
#
# A network uses ONE shared private key.
# Any new network participant can use this key to join at any current node
#
# Private address ranges as reference:
# 10.0.0.0/8 IP addresses: 10.0.0.0 – 10.255.255.255
# 172.16.0.0/12 IP addresses: 172.16.0.0 – 172.31.255.255
# 192.168.0.0/16 IP addresses: 192.168.0.0 – 192.168.255.255
#
# For peers with static ports: make sure, that firewall does not block arriving UDP traffic
# In the case below, this would be 50000 and 55555
