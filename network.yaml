# This is an example config file for a wireguard network
#
# A network uses ONE shared private key.
# Any new network participant can use this key to join any wireguard network at any current node
#
# In order to join a network following steps to be applied:
# - set up wireguard interface with ip as defined in <newParticipant>.
# - every active wireguard node receives packets from <newParticipant> with <privateKey>
# - Then a (UDP ?) connection is established, so that the new participant receives initial network information
# - With this information the wireguard interface is reconfigured as an active wireguard node
#
# If two new participants join at the same time, then one may be the lucky one to receive the initial UDP packet.
# The loosing particpant has to try again
