# This is an example config file for a wireguard network
#
# A network uses ONE shared private key.
# Any new network participant can use this key to join any wireguard network at any current node
#
# In order to join a network following steps to be applied:
# - set up wireguard interface with ip as defined in <newParticipant>.
# - every active wireguard node receives packets from <newParticipant> with <privateKey>
# - Then a (UDP ?) connection is established, so that the new participant receives initial network information
# - With this information the wireguard interface is reconfigured as an active wireguard node
#
# If two new participants join at the same time, then one may be the lucky one to receive the initial UDP packet.
# The loosing participant has to try again
#
# Every network participant with static public IP and fixed port will open up two wireguard interfaces:
# - first for new participants to join the network - port <wgJoinPort>
# - second to perform the actual vpn communication - port <wgPort>
#
# Private address ranges:
# 10.0.0.0/8 IP addresses: 10.0.0.0 – 10.255.255.255
# 172.16.0.0/12 IP addresses: 172.16.0.0 – 172.31.255.255
# 192.168.0.0/16 IP addresses: 192.168.0.0 – 192.168.255.255
#
# For peers with static ports: make sure, that firewall does not block arriving UDP traffic
# Moreover the LISTEN_PORT 55555 must not be blocked by the firewall, too
